# Number Order Game (1–9)

A tiny, teacher-friendly game for K–2 students. Drag the cards into the correct order, then click **Check**.

## How to publish with GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository (e.g., `number-order-game`).
2. Upload the files in this zip (at minimum `index.html`).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`, then select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder. Save.
4. Wait a moment for the site to build. Your site will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/number-order-game/`.
5. Share that link with students (also works inside Clever or Google Classroom).

## Options
- Use the **Shuffle**, **Check**, and **Reset** buttons.
- Keyboard accessible: Tab → Enter (pick up) → Arrow keys to move → Enter (drop).
